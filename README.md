# LIME: Library of Interventions for Meat Elimination

LIME is a continuously growing collection of experimental studies examining psychological interventions to reduce animal product consumption and improve attitudes towards animals. With LIME, you can explore individual studies, understand the current state of research, and evaluate which interventions have the strongest evidence behind them.

We're always looking for extra help to make LIME as useful as it can be. Please contact us if you want to help build the database or make an Issue here if you've found a bug.
