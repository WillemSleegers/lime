# TODO

## Data Quality and Coding Review

### High Priority
- [ ] **Review and validate data codings** - Go through the database systematically and check coding decisions for accuracy and consistency. Suggest improvements where appropriate.
  - Review intervention content categorizations (animal welfare, health, environment, etc.)
  - Validate intervention mechanism classifications
  - Check outcome subcategory assignments
  - Verify study design classifications
  - Review sample type categorizations
  - Suggest alternative or additional coding schemes where current ones may be inadequate

### Areas to Focus On
- Look for inconsistencies in how similar studies/interventions are coded
- Identify potential missing categories or overly broad/narrow classifications
- Check for coding errors or ambiguous cases that need clarification
- Suggest refinements to improve the utility and interpretability of the database

### Goal
Serve as a collaborator to polish, check, and improve the database quality and usability for researchers and advocates working on animal welfare interventions.
