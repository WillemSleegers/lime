                  LIME is primarily designed for researchers and activists or
                  policy makers who are somewhat familiar with scientific
                  research. In many ways, the website is designed to make
                  scientific results more accessible for non-scientists. It
                  facilitates the exploration and analysis of scientific
                  studies, especially for people who do not regularly search for
                  and read scientific publications. However, some background
                  knowledge in statistics and scientific research is
                  recommended, especially when using the meta-analysis tool.

                  We include studies that measured various outcomes related to

                  <li>
                    Intentions: intended future meat consumption, intentions to

                  These outcomes were measured online, in research laboratories,
                  or in the field. In most cases, measures were taken
                  immediately after the intervention. Most measures focus on
                  meat consumption in general, although some studies also
                  examined specific categories of meat (e.g., red and processed
                  meat, factory farmed meat) or other animal products (e.g.,
                  milk, eggs).

                  Each tab has its own set of filters to help you narrow down
                  what you&apos;re looking at. For example, you might filter
                  papers by publication year, or studies by sample size.

                <p>
                  The lock feature is useful when you want to maintain your
                  focus across different levels. If you filter to show only
                  preregistered studies, you can lock that filter, then switch
                  to the Interventions tab to see only the techniques used in
                  preregistered studies.

                  Generally speaking, the goal of a meta-analysis is to combine
                  the results of many studies on a specific question in a
                  quantitative way. For example, we may want to know if
                  informing people about the conditions on factory farms reduces
                  their meat consumption. Researchers run experiments to test
                  the effect of such interventions, but the effect size (i.e.,
                  by how much meat consumption was changed) may depend on the
                  specific populations that is studied, the specific wording of
                  the educational text, how soon after the intervention meat
                  consumption was measured, and many other factors. By averaging
                  the results from all these studies, we get a better
                  understanding of how effective the intervention is in general.

                  You can select based on the type of intervention that was
                  tested (e.g., only animal welfare appeals), the type of
                  outcome measure that was used (e.g., only sales data), the

                  indicators. The website then displays various results for the

                  Meta-analyses provide the average effect across many studies.
                  This average is more meaningful if we compare studies that are
                  more similar to each other. Averaging apples and oranges may
                  not be meaningful. Setting relatively narrow criteria help
                  reduce variation between studies, making it easier to compare
                  results and draw more meaningful conclusions. However, when
                  widening the inclusion criteria, more studies are included,
                  which increases the statistical power and precision of the
                  meta-analysis. By adjusting your inclusion criteria, you can
                  navigate this tradeoff. Ultimately, your inclusion criteria
                  depend on which question you want to address.

                  Effect size measures such as Cohen&apos;s d can be used to
                  quantify differences between groups on some variable of
                  interest. For example, if an intervention leads to a larger
                  reduction in meat consumption relative to a control group,
                  this will be reflected in a larger effect size. This{" "}

                  There are many reasons why you should not be too confident
                  that an intervention will be equally effective, or even
                  effective at all, in a different context. The effectiveness of
                  an intervention is not only influenced by the type of
                  intervention that was tested, but also by many other factors.
                  The participants in the original study may have been more open
                  to change their consumption (e.g., university students). The
                  original study may have only assessed intentions to reduce
                  meat consumption, which could overstate the true effectiveness
                  because people donâ€™t always follow up on their intentions.

                  to distort their results so that they are more likely to be

                  To address these difficulties, you could use LIME to find
                  studies that have tested interventions that more closely match
                  the sample you have in mind or have applied the intervention
                  in a setting more similar to yours. You can also use LIME to
                  assess the meta-analytic estimates of interventions, which may
                  be more robust than those from a single study.

                  It is difficult to judge how reliable and generalizable the
                  results of a specific study are. But, all else being equal,
                  there are three indicators that you could pay attention to.
                </p>

                    <strong>Sample size</strong>: Studies with larger
                    participant samples will provide more reliable estimates of
                    group differences. For example, to be 90% certain that you
                    will find a statistically significant difference between two
                    groups for a realistic effect size (a Cohen&apos;s d of
                    0.25), you would already need 338 participants in each
                    condition (676 in total). Few studies are this large.
                    Smaller studies will yield noisier effect sizes.
                    Meta-analyses are meant to address this problem. By
                    averaging over many studies, the random variability of
                    single studies can cancel out, leading to more reliable
                    estimates of the true effect size.

                    <strong>Outcome measure</strong>: If you are interested in
                    reducing meat consumption, then you could only focus on
                    studies that measured consumption more directly. Many
                    studies assessed intentions to reduce meat consumption in
                    the future, but we know that people don&apos;t always
                    implement their intentions (the intention-behavior gap).
                    Participants may also say that they will eat less meat even
                    if they don&apos;t intend to, just because they think
                    it&apos;s the socially desirable thing to say or it&apos;s
                    what the researcher wants to hear.
