The reasoning is as follows: Despite having the same capacity to suffer, farmed animals are denied the protection of animal cruelty laws that protect dogs and cats. This means that it is legal and widespread to cause immense suffering to animals raised for food. This includes painful surgical mutilations (without pain relief) and in most cases, intensive and unnatural overcrowding or confinement, and often a painful and traumatic slaughter. There are over 500 million animals confined like this in factory farms in Australia today. The vast majorityof these animals today are birds. It takes more than 200 chickens to provide the same number of meals as one cow.If we can convince someone to stop eating birds, they would go from being responsible for the factory farming and slaughtering of more than two dozen land animals per year to fewer than one. Furthermore, while most cows and sheep raised in Australia spend most of their life grazing, the vast majority of chickens are raised in crowded factory farms.\""

Adopting a reductionist diet is appealing because not everyone is willing to follow an all-or-nothing diet. It is also a powerful way to reduce animal cruelty. For example, halving your meat consumption will spare around 50 innocent lives every year. This includes about 13 land animals, and 37 fish and shellfish every year.\""

Households in another group received the same intervention but also received a group goal of 5% as well as group feedback about average and total energy savings of all participants. More specifically, information was given about energy related problems and the need to do something about them. The information contained an explanation of the global warming phenomenon. It also featured information about the increase in energy use over the last decades and the increased costs of energy use, with accompanying graphs depicting these trends. Households then received a list of tailored energy-saving measures. Each household only received those energy-saving options that were relevant for them. For each energy-saving measure an indication was given of the amount of energy that could potentially be saved. Households were then asked to try and save 5% energy during the course of the study. Households were free to choose which energy-saving measures they would adopt to attain the goal. Households in the group feedback condition were told the aim was to save 5% energy as a group of participants. It was emphasized that as a group, households in Groningen could make an important contribution to energy conservation and would help reduce energy-related problems. Tailored individual feedback was given about energy savings via a website in three different ways. First, as a percentage change in total energy use, compared to the ﬁrst measurement (viz., before the intervention). This was also related to the 5% goal, e.g. ‘‘You have (not) attained the 5% goal (yet)’’. Second, tailored feedback was given about the extent to which each energy-saving behavior had contributed to total changes in energy use. A bar chart was displayed, with a green bar indicating a reduction in energy use for a given option, and a red bar indicating an increase in energy use. Third, the amount of money (in Euros) each household had saved on their gas and electricity bills was displayed on the website. In addition, households in the group feedback condition received feedback about average as well as total energy savings of the entire group of participants, in relation to the group goal of 5%, one month after the second measurement via a newsletter."

To avoid weight gain, replacing other foods was emphasized over adding soya foods. To maintain compliance, all participants received individual dietary counselling by a registered dietitian and follow-up phone calls. They had at least six contacts with the dietitian during the ﬁrst year and were counselled on how to maintain a healthy diet according to the food guide pyramid."
