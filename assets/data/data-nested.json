This means that it is legal and widespread to cause immense suffering to animals raised for food. This includes painful surgical mutilations (without pain relief) and in most cases, intensive and unnatural overcrowding or confinement, and often a painful and traumatic slaughter. There are over 500 million animals confined like this in factoryfarms in Australia today. This includes cows, pigs, sheep and chickens. Adopting a reductionist diet is appealing because not everyone is willing to follow an all-or-nothing diet. It is also a powerful way to reduce animal cruelty. For example, halving your meat consumption will spare around 50 innocent lives every year. This includes about 13 land animals, and 37 fish and shellfish every year.\""

Are there any reasons why I should limit my meat consumption or stop eating meat entirely?”. Participants were given a list of questions they could ask ChatGPT, but were also told that they could decide where to steer the conversation. The provided questions focused on the environment (e.g., “How does meat consumption impact the environment?”), personal health (e.g., “Is it necessary to eat meat to be healthy?”), and animal welfare (e.g., “What percentage of meat in Dutch supermarkets comes from factory farms?”), and also included more generic prompts (e.g., “It would be quite difficult to reduce my meat consumption by a lot. How can I make this easier?”)."

To avoid weight gain, replacing other foods was emphasized over adding soya foods. To maintain compliance, all participants received individual dietary counselling by a registered dietitian and follow-up phone calls. They had at least six contacts with the dietitian during the ﬁrst year and were counselled on how to maintain a healthy diet according to the food guide pyramid."
