This includes painful surgical mutilations (without pain relief) and in most cases, intensive and unnatural overcrowding or confinement, and often a painful and traumatic slaughter. There are over 500 million animals confined like this in factory farms in Australia today. The vast majorityof these animals today are birds. It takes more than 200 chickens to provide the same number of meals as one cow.If we can convince someone to stop eating birds, they would go from being responsible for the factory farming and slaughtering of more than two dozen land animals per year to fewer than one. Furthermore, while most cows and sheep raised in Australia spend most of their life grazing, the vast majority of chickens are raised in crowded factory farms.\"",
