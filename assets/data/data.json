The provided questions focused on the environment (e.g., “How does meat consumption impact the environment?”), personal health (e.g., “Is it necessary to eat meat to be healthy?”), and animal welfare (e.g., “What percentage of meat in Dutch supermarkets comes from factory farms?”), and also included more generic prompts (e.g., “It would be quite difficult to reduce my meat consumption by a lot.
