To increase self-efficacy participants received concrete tips on planning meat-free meals, substituting meat products, and choosing meatless meals in restaurants. Participants set agoal for the following month regarding their meat consumption by choosing one of the three following options: reduce the quantity of meat they consume, stay at the same level of meat consumption, or increase meat consumption., Text-messaging reinforcement of the informational and self-monitoring components.

The reasoning is as follows: Livestock agriculture contributes up to a quarter of global greenhouse gas emissions, with almost all of this coming from cows and sheep. In Australia, producing 1 kg of beef requires an average of 15,182 L of water. Furthermore, livestock agriculture drives 80% of deforestation worldwide, using up a third of the world s ice-free land. Adopting a Climatarian diet is a powerfulway to reduce your impact on the climate. Shifting to a Climatarian diet will reduce your carbon footprint by approximately 1000 kg of CO2 every year, or the equivalent of driving from Perth to Brisbane.\"",

    "intervention_description": "One group of households received a combination of tailored information about possibilities to reduce energy use, individual goal setting (5% reduction), and tailored individual feedback about their own energy savings. Households in another group received the same intervention but also received a group goal of 5% as well as group feedback about average and total energy savings of all participants. More specifically, information was given about energy related problems and the need to do something about them. The information contained an explanation of the global warming phenomenon. It also featured information about the increase in energy use over the last decades and the increased costs of energy use, with accompanying graphs depicting these trends. Households then received a list of tailored energy-saving measures. Each household only received those energy-saving options that were relevant for them. For each energy-saving measure an indication was given of the amount of energy that could potentially be saved. Households were then asked to try and save 5% energy during the course of the study. Households were free to choose which energy-saving measures they would adopt to attain the goal. Households in the group feedback condition were told the aim was to save 5% energy as a group of participants. It was emphasized that as a group, households in Groningen could make an important contribution to energy conservation and would help reduce energy-related problems. Tailored individual feedback was given about energy savings via a website in three different ways. First, as a percentage change in total energy use, compared to the ﬁrst measurement (viz., before the intervention). This was also related to the 5% goal, e.g. ‘‘You have (not) attained the 5% goal (yet)’’. Second, tailored feedback was given about the extent to which each energy-saving behavior had contributed to total changes in energy use. A bar chart was displayed, with a green bar indicating a reduction in energy use for a given option, and a red bar indicating an increase in energy use. Third, the amount of money (in Euros) each household had saved on their gas and electricity bills was displayed on the website. In addition, households in the group feedback condition received feedback about average as well as total energy savings of the entire group of participants, in relation to the group goal of 5%, one month after the second measurement via a newsletter.",
