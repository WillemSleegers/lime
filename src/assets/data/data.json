To increase self-efficacy participants received concrete tips on planning meat-free meals, substituting meat products, and choosing meatless meals in restaurants. Participants set agoal for the following month regarding their meat consumption by choosing one of the three following options: reduce the quantity of meat they consume, stay at the same level of meat consumption, or increase meat consumption., Text-messaging reinforcement of the informational and self-monitoring components. The messages sent upbeat and educational information that reminded participants of the benefits of reducing meat consumption and provided them with additional tips and links to recipes.",

The reasoningis as follows: Despite having the same capacity to suffer, farmed animals are denied the protection of animal cruelty laws that protect dogs and cats. This means that it is legal and widespread to cause immense suffering to animals raised for food. This includes painful surgical mutilations (without pain relief) and in most cases, intensive and unnatural overcrowding or confinement, and often a painful and traumatic slaughter. There are over 500 million animals confined like this in factory farms in Australia today. This includes cows, pigs, sheep and chickens. Adopting a vegetarian diet is the most powerful way to object to animal cruelty, and by doing so, you will spare approximately 100 animal lives (25 land animals and 75 fish and shellfish) every year.\"",
