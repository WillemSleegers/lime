The reasoning is as follows: Livestock agriculture contributes up to a quarter of global greenhouse gas emissions, with almost all of this coming from cows and sheep. In Australia, producing 1 kg of beef requires an average of 15,182 L of water. Furthermore, livestock agriculture drives 80% of deforestation worldwide, using up a third of the world s ice-free land. Adopting a Climatarian diet is a powerfulway to reduce your impact on the climate. Shifting to a Climatarian diet will reduce your carbon footprint by approximately 1000 kg of CO2 every year, or the equivalent of driving from Perth to Brisbane.\"",

The reasoning is as follows: Despite having the same capacity to suffer, farmed animals are denied the protection of animal cruelty laws that protect dogs and cats. This means that it is legal and widespread to cause immense suffering to animals raised for food. This includes painful surgical mutilations (without pain relief) and in most cases, intensive and unnatural overcrowding or confinement, and often a painful and traumatic slaughter. There are over 500 million animals confined like this in factory farms in Australia today. The vast majorityof these animals today are birds. It takes more than 200 chickens to provide the same number of meals as one cow.If we can convince someone to stop eating birds, they would go from being responsible for the factory farming and slaughtering of more than two dozen land animals per year to fewer than one. Furthermore, while most cows and sheep raised in Australia spend most of their life grazing, the vast majority of chickens are raised in crowded factory farms.\"",

Adopting a reductionist diet is appealing because not everyone is willing to follow an all-or-nothing diet. It is also a powerful way to reduce animal cruelty. For example, halving your meat consumption will spare around 50 innocent lives every year. This includes about 13 land animals, and 37 fish and shellfish every year.\"",
